                                        <p>This is an album discovery tool powered by <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>.
                                        <p>Having used many common radio services for discovering new music, I found that there are really none that offer album-based recommendations. So I went ahead and started developing Beatmap. Simply by searching for an artist, users can discover countless unheard albums and widen their musical catalog. These recommendations are based off of last.fm's catalog of related artists.</p>
                                        <p>I chose Backbone.Marionette as my front-end framework for its powerful composite view management and modularity. Packaged in Marionette is Backbone.Wreqr, which makes routes a breeze. Underscore is used for its light-weight templating and plethora of utility methods. Bootstrap is used for its large collection of UI components and straight-forward grid system. I use LESS for its nested styles and handy variable declarations. Grunt is wonderful for task-watching, auto-compiling, and other handy tasks such as auto-minification.</p>
                                        <p>I have a huge list of features I would love to add to this service, and I see endless opportunities for improvement. Features like links to music-playing services are a top priority, as well as an ability to catalog albums into playlists of sorts. I hope to soon add a way to login to one's last.fm account, and have recommendations be further tailored based on listening history.</p>

                                        <p><em>Stack used: jQuery, Bootstrap, fullcalendar.js, Todoist API</em></p>
                                        <p>In my Human-Computer Interaction class, we were assigned a term project to design and develop an application that will help manage the huge amount of information present in everyday life. We decided to make a task manager, that acts a bit like a personal assistant for everyday life. Given a calendar of events and obligations, and a task list of things to get done, our application will find an optimized schedule that ensures that everything will get done, with time to spare.</p>
                                        <p>In 10 weeks, we produced a proof-of-concept that handles adding calendar events, Todoist integration, and basic schedule optimization. Tasks are prioritized by due date, and duration can be set per task. Certain times of day are sectioned off where no tasks can be scheduled, such as early morning and late evening.</p>
                                        <p>As this was just a proof-of-concept and the project was more focused on useability testing, there are many features we fantasized about adding. Eventually we would like tasks to be prioritized by other factors such as significance or importance. We would also like tasks to be able to broken up into smaller segments, so that a task can get done over several days. This division of a task can be set, so that some tasks can get done in 10 minute increments and others in 30 minutes, for example. Google Calendar integration would be very helpful as well.</p>
                                        <p>Our project recieved very positive reviews, with many testers expressing interest in using a more finalized version. We won second place in the iFixit useability contest, and got t-shirts that said iFixit on them.</p>
